  # unit tests for get_principal_access
  # Get the permitted access for a principal in the tenant (defaults to principal from the identity header)
  # Access responses are sorted in ascending order by an ID internal to the database
  # @param application The application name(s) to obtain access for the principal. This is an exact match. When no application is supplied, all permissions for the principal are returned. You may also use a comma-separated list to match on multiple applications.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :username Unique username of the principal to obtain access for (only available for admins, and if supplied, takes precedence over the identity header).
  # @option opts [String] :order_by Parameter for ordering roles by value. For inverse ordering, supply &#39;-&#39; before the param value, such as: ?order_by&#x3D;-application
  # @option opts [String] :status Set the status of users to get back.
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit Parameter for selecting the amount of data returned.
  # @option opts [Integer] :offset Parameter for selecting the offset of data.
  # @return [AccessPagination]
